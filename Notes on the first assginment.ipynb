    "    <b>An Overview of the VAST Challenge 2018:</b> *\"Cheep\" Shots?* <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In 2017, the VAST Challenge results suggested that the Kasios Furniture manufacturing company may have been a primary contributor to the apparent reduction of the number of nesting pairs of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit, a favorite bird of Mistford residents and Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve visitors. Kasios supposedly used the banned substance Methylosmolene in their manufacturing process.</p>\n",
    "<p>Kasios now claims that the analysis was flawed and biased. To combat these conclusions, Kasios has launched their own “investigation” into the Pipit situation, and they are now reporting that there are plenty of Rose-crested Blue Pipits happily living and nesting in the Preserve. To back up this claim, they have provided a set of Pipit bird calls, recently recorded across the Preserve, with locations of where they were recorded. Clearly, they claim, the Pipits are a thriving population, and Kasios will provide even more supporting evidence as their investigation proceeds.</p>\n",
    "<p> Given a collection of bird calls from the Preserve that has been vetted by various ornithology groups as having accurate identifications, the aim of the challenge is to apply machine learning and visual analytics technique to classify the calls and to verify whether the numbers of the Rose-crested Blue Pipit have suffered as a result of Kasios's dumping site or the claims are unfounded and the findings of the company are valid.\n",

    "<h3>Our Process:</h3>\n",
    "<p>As for any challenge of this kind, first, we started by extracting the data about the bird from the CSV file \"All_Birds.csv\". There was some preprocessing to be done on the data because some rows presented invalid values or diffrent formatting of the data (the case of dates in the pandas dataframe).<br>\n",
    "One more preprocessing was done, but this time on the map provided with challenge data to make it look less choppy. So we started, by resizing the map from a 200x200 image to 800x800 so that when we plot bigger plots it doesn't get pixelated and then we applied some transformations (gaussian blur, edge smoothing,etc...) to get something that looks more natural.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>Once we got our data \"cleaned\", we were ready to start visualizing.</p>\n",
    "<p>At first, we plotted all the bird's records (of all time) on the map so that we get some sense of where the birds can be found. Afterwards, we made a reprsentation of the locations of every bird depending on its type. And on the final iteration, we made it possible to visualize the position of each type of bird on a specific date. Furthermore, we made it possible to see the position of the birds provided by kasios of the \"Unknown type\". These birds are represented with different markers and size than the vetted data provided by the ornithology groups, to distinguish it from the rest of the vetted data.</p>\n",
    "<p>We used the bokeh library to create our interactive maps, with the options to select one or multiple types of the 19 types of birds to view on the map and the ability to see the evolution of their traveling habits over time (from 1983 to 2018)</p>\n",
    "<p>An important part of the analysis was to generate plot that depict the migration pattern of all the birds over time (base on the data we have) espcially the migration patter of the Rose-crested Blue Pipit which is displayed below. We can clearly see the population of this type of birds fleeing the dumping site area and settling a little to the south.</p>\n",
    "<p>The other birds seem unaffected with the presence of the dumping site as most of them did not have a huge presence of nests around the dumping site area. (Their migration pattern is displayed below)</p>"
